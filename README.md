# GCChat-Server

**Server side for the GCChat-Client**

**WARNING: This chat client at the moment has no encryption, or channels. This is just a PoC that
might be developed better in the future**

This chat client is an experiment, a test for me to learn Golang. However, since the client
has no use of just having the code sitting on a random alley, the source code and binaries are
public for anyone to tinker with.

There are probably other ways to make a chat client, but I decided to go for the approach I am using
right now. The code is documented in the best way I can, which is... not really good, but I hope it
suffices.
